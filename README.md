# Starlight-Challenge
The repository for the code written in the HackSussex Hackathon for the Rolls-Royce Starlight Challenge

This repository contains 5 Arduino .ino files, which can be run in the Arduino IDE.
The setup consisted of the Arduino, 4 AdaFruit 8x8 NeoPixel LED plates, an accelerometer, and a Rolls-Royce in-car microphone.

The 5 files are listed below:
  - Intro: Fades from black into the Union Jack, then sweeps away the flag and reveals the Rolls-Royce logo.
  - Stars: Creates a random display of stars, always unique
  - Twinkle: An interactive show of randomly twinkling lights and stars fading in and out at different speeds
  - Music Spiral: Responsive music display that pulses with the rhythm of the music being played
  - Accelerometer: Reacts to the acceleration of the car, filling the ceiling with more lights the stronger the force
  
  
All these programs were created during the HackSusssex Hackathon 2017 in a period of 24 hours by the team Interstellar.
